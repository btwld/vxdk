# Plugins

VXDK is designed to be extensible. You can create your own plugins to extend the functionality of the player. Plugins can be used to add new features, modify existing features, or even create new themes.

When looking at the source code, you will see that all major features are implemented as plugins. This includes core features like load, state, autoplay, and others.
